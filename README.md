# WoW Recruitment BackEnd
 An (purposefully) over-engineered piece of code intended for applying technologies and patterns in order add to my tech stack skill set while attempting to solve problems I came across in my hobby!

 Since I've been playing World of Warcraft as a hobby for quite some time (more than I'm willing to admit :laughing:) and I'm a guild _- and raid -_ leader, I have the constant need to recruit new players to fill in our team's roster. While there are countless tools to manage guild rosters, I decided it would be a great project to develop as a way to train my skills and explore technologies I would not be able to use in any of the projects I'm currently working on, while applying those to a real world problem.

 By creating this project and tackling the problems I face in my hobby and recreating some of the existing solutions adding my personal touch, I hope to both experiment with technologies I've already used, been wanting to use, or have only heard of AND showcase my expertise (or lack thereof :laughing:) in Web Development, System Design and problem solving.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is focused in being a way to keep myself up-to-date to the state of PHP Web Development and Best Practices in 2024 while also exploring some new exciting technologies :)
>
> There are already solutions for this problem out there, and given the scale and scope of the market for those solutions it might not necessarily need the over-engineering (hopefully) applied to this project. The purpose of this project is `NOT` to Keep It Simple, but rather apply technologies to study them and feel comfortable using them on professional projects.

# Project Main Goals
> [!WARNING]
> This might never - _and probably will never_ - actually be deployed into production

It `SHOULD` accomplish the following:
- Showcase **SOME** of what I can offer as a developer :sunglasses:
- Replicate and extend on current solutions for the same problem
- Follow SOLID Principles
- Follow [PHP Best Practices](https://phptherightway.com/)
- Follow [Symfony's Best Practices](https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html)
- Integrate [Battle.net REST API](https://develop.battle.net/documentation)
- Be easy to deploy a dev environment
- Have tests in its CI Pipeline
